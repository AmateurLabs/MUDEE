An Entity-Attribute-Behaviour Model based MUD engine designed for data-driven and realtime content creation. Communicates over a raw TCP connection with a simple length-prefixed message format.

The Entity-Attribute-Behaviour Model is a modified form of the Entity-Component Model. The basic idea is that instead of heavy polymorphism via inheritance, entities are formed from individual, self-contained components. The EAB model differs from the EC model in that Components are split into Attributes and Behaviours.

Entities are simple containers for Attributes and Behaviours, with only a UID hard-coded.

Attributes are completely self-contained, and contain no functional code besides getters and setters which can constrain values and throw events. They have no dependencies, and don't recieve events. Only attribute data is serialized.

Behaviours are dependent only on specifically defined Attributes, and contain only private, non-serialized data. They have no means of interacting with other Behaviours except indirectly by modifying Attribute data or by throwing and catching events.

Even Rooms and Zones are Entities, with special Behaviours to provide their functionality.
