An Entity-Attribute-Behaviour Model based MUD engine designed for data-driven and realtime content creation. Communicates over a raw TCP connection using standard newline-delimited ASCII bytes.

The Entity-Attribute-Behaviour Model is a modified form of the Entity-Component Model. The basic idea is that instead of heavy polymorphism via inheritance, entities are formed from individual, self-contained components. The EAB model differs from the EC model in that Components are split into Attributes and Behaviours.

Entities are simple containers for Attributes and Behaviours, with only a UID hard-coded. They can be generated either piece-by-piece at runtime, from an EntityPrefab, or by cloning an existing Entity.

Attributes are completely self-contained, and contain no functional code besides getters and setters which can constrain values and throw events. They have no dependencies, and don't recieve events. Only attribute data is serialized.

Behaviours are dependent only on specifically defined Attributes, and contain only private, non-serialized data. They have no means of interacting with other Behaviours except indirectly by modifying Attribute data or by throwing and catching events.

Even Rooms and Zones are Entities, with special Behaviours to provide their functionality. For example, a typical mob entity might look like this:
	Entity
		uid=35363
		NameAttribute
			name=Slimy Orc
		HealthAttribute
			health=50
			maxHealth=100
			sendsEvents=true
		WeaponSlotAttribute
			weaponUid=CURVED_SWORD
		WanderBehaviour
		AggroBehaviour
		SwordWielderBehaviour
